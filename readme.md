# Blank canvas

Wanna write some beginner canvas code
Copying: https://github.com/nodeschool/wellington/tree/master/website

Inspired by cool people doing canvas things
- @ahdinosaur's https://play.gridbeam.xyz
- Nodeschool Wellington's website: https://nodeschool.io/wellington/
- Not canvas, but some very cool stuff https://xkcd.com/1608/

Todo:
- have got ripples expanding and resetting. That's OK
- have bubbles floating around the canvas box
    - spawn with random size and direction
- if bubbles hit edge of box, they bounce off - change direction
- bubbles lose velocity each bounce
- bubbles gain velocity on mouseleave (shake mouse on bubbles to speed up)
- bubbles bounce off each other
- if bubble hits corner: do >something<
